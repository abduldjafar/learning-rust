The room is modest but functional, the apartement was clean and the instructions very clear. The room faces Las Ramblas so like any room in El Raval, it will be quite noisy at night.

And what can I say? It was great! Being located near to Plaza Catalunya and La Rambla, the apartment is very central and perfect to go everythere you want to - by feet and metro. If you want to visit Parc Güell for example, you can jump directly on the metro line L3 which leads there. \n\nTogether with us were two other people in the apartment, but that wasn't a problem at all. The room was a two-bed room with a small balcony facing the street side with a nice view on the wild La Rambla. \n\nWe only got to know Paolo who did the check-in and check-out, always having an open ear for all the questions coming to your mind. Because our flight home was not before the evening, he offered to leave the luggage in the apartment even after the check-out and come back later to get it. So as you can see, a very kind and attentive guy. Thanks again Paolo :-))\n\nLike mentioned also in other reviews before: Being located on La Rambla with a lot of bars, it can get a little noisy outside during the night. So I definitly recommend to bring some earplugs with you - just in case you can't fall asleep. Now in winter it was ok, but I don't know how it will be in summer. Coming to warmth and cold: The room also contains a heating and a ventilator thus you will be prepared for summer and winter.\n\nAll in all: There's everything you need for a small, but comfortable stay.\n"},{"_id":"129052709","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1485666000000"}},"listing_id":"4586762","reviewer_id":"81985009","reviewer_name":"Ang","comments":"We only ended up meeting Tony's roommate Paolo, but everything was great!

Walking along the trail was a good start for a day. The two adorable cats are sociable enough to hang out with me for sone time. Watching sunset at resort pool was another gift. The best part of the stay was that I could purchase beautiful postcards drawn by Malia. I will never forget their warm-hearted smile with these cards.

While there was air conditioning provided, we did not need to use it as the evening breeze going into the room was cool and relaxing. And in the morning, the lovely sound of birds chirping welcomed us to the day ahead.\n\nThe beach at Turtle Bay, a couple of hiking trails, a good restaurant and a nice bar were within short walking distance of Malia's place.  Famous food trucks are a short drive away, and the Polynesian Cultural Center, North Shore beaches and other attractions are easy drives from her place.\n\nHad the chance to talk to Malia about her paintings (my wife and I loved them!) at the tail end of our stay and heard stories about her family and their 40 year life in Hawaii - I just wished we had more time to stay.

After checking kamaaina rates the price was still over $300 a night so we looked at Airbnb for something on the North Shore. We found this lovely room for under $100 a night and it was literally on the Turtle Bay golf course. We didn't need anything major just a place to shower and sleep.  However, the room was spacious,  internet/cable were available and we had a fridge.  The bathroom was immaculate and right next to the room.  Malia and her husband took the time to great us and ensured we were acquainted with the area.  We spent the days on the beach and eating in some great Restaurants in Haliewa.

The king size bed was so very comfortable! She provided beach towels, robes, and coffee in the mornings.  Malia and Bernie are available for conversation including suggestions about local trails and beaches and activities. The swimming pool is close to their apartment and lovely.  There are many beaches within walking distance, all with unique features, and many others within 15 or 20 min drive. The amenities provided by the Turtle Bay resort include golf, horseback riding and bike rental.  We chose to do the Night time Glow Paddle at Haleiwa Bay offered through AirBnb. That was delightful. \nFor two people needing a home base on the North Shore, Malia's place is the perfect home.

And I did raise this issue with the host’s husband on the 3rd day, he admitted that his wife might have used it when we were not there.\n\nAlthough the kitchen rule stated that guests can cook their own meals; however, the living area of the host is very closed to the kitchen and the eating area (right next to each other), you can feel very uncomfortable because the host can make you feel that her personal space is being invaded by you (that was what happened on our 4th day morning that the female host made few abrupt remarks when we were using her kitchen to make toast and having coffee as our breakfast). We didn’t want to be an intruder so since then we did try our best to avoid using the kitchen while the female host is there.\nMay be the host should include a more detailed kitchen rules so the guests can make an informed decision before making booking in her house.\n\nIf you don’t like the cats to be in your  bathroom or your bedroom or on your bed (one of the two cats  jumped on our bed) you need to keep your doors closed. \n\nThis house is right next to the golf course, we were woke up shortly after 5am every couple days by the loud motor of the mobile crane (which is parked not far from the house)  that they used for pruning trees and park nearby. So you might like to use your earplugs, which we didn’t bring with us."},{"_id":"345322922","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1541304000000"}},"listing_id":"438923","reviewer_id":"42079486","reviewer_name":"TJ (Titus)","comments":"Thank you so much!

It was great value for money and a central location on the north shore. \n\nThe bed was huge and extremely comfortable with a big tv, fridge, towels, snorkel gear, snacks and other things provided in the room which made us feel very at home. The shared kitchen and private bathroom facilities were as decribed and clean. The beach and turtle bay resort were within walking distance and only short distances in the car to food trucks, shops, Polynesian cultural centre, hikes, Ziplining, horse riding, snorkeling etc.\n\nMalia and Bernie were very welcoming and also very respectful of privacy.

Besides there are a lot of additional equipment like bathrobe, slippers, beach chairs, tennis rackets, flippers, etc. We had a lot of luggage but still had enough space in the room. The bed is very comfortable and we had a very good night´s sleep. You can darken the room and it is a very silent area, you just hear the sound of the ocean. It is a very nice and safe community, the beach is nearby and you can also use the pool or tennis courts. There are also some nice trails around Turtle Bay.
