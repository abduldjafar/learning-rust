While others have met Paula’s mother, Paula oriented me. She was waiting with a warm greeting on the front doorstep – even though my train was late – when I arrived in my taxi [8 Euros – have change!] It is a comfortable, elegant, stylish and cool refuge. Almost everything you may need has been provided – you just need your hairdryer and bathroom toiletries. Reliable WIFI. It is located close to Rua Santa Caterina (main shopping boulevard) and Rua Formosa in the city centre. The fully renovated studio apartment is housed in an historic building on the FIRST floor [for those with heavy luggage like mine] with a grand entry, polished marble stairs and features glorious space with 15ft ceilings and gigantic windows. They open to a petite balconette with a small table setting for those who smoke, or for drying travel laundry securely. At night I opened the shuttered doors to let in the cooling evening breeze. It is a short walk to the traveller’s friend – the pingo doce supermarket and the Via Caterina shopping centre. Down the hill at 58 Formosa you will find the traditional market - \"Mercado do Bolhao\" - the Bolhao Market. I can also recommend a charming, family restaurant hosted enthusiastically by the son. It has an excellent budget menu – “economico” - Restaurante Don Rodrigo, in our street @ no. 37/39. For 5.50 Euros – vegetable soup & bread / meat or fish main / ½ litre wine (drink choice) and coffee. [See trip advisor reviews]. It also has a quaint outdoor patio & courtyard garden. The landmarks for “home” – Ibis Hotel, Residential Gabriel, Garage Elephante, Aquario (electronic shops). Paula also made life easier by booking a taxi back to the train station and kindly sent me text messages confirming our arrangements. Thank you Paula, and sadly, goodbye Porto!"},{"_id":"15906994","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1405656000000"}},"listing_id":"2758817","reviewer_id":"14449944","reviewer_name":"Susan","comments":"I would definitely recommend this apartment for one or two people, preferably a couple. The apt. is as shown in the add. It is very tastefully decorated and uses the small space well. It is all you need for a week or two stay and it is located around the corner from the metro stop. You can also walk to the center or to the river from the apt. We had some lovely breakfasts on the terrace, which is definitely a plus. The kitchen has all you need for meals, including a refrigerator, burners and electric heating items. The bed is super comfortable as were the pillows, showing that the host put a lot into selecting items for comfort. I even want to see if I can buy the pillows. Paula, the host, was very flexible with the time for check in for I didn't know up until the day what bus I was taking from Fatima. She met us and there was a glass of wine for my husband and I, a nice touch. There was also a map of Porto, which was helpful and she was available for any questions. The shower works well and provides consistent hot water. The towels were soft and very adequate. The cost was extremely reasonable. You really can't get a lovely room with a terrace close to all the attractions at this rate. I would highly recommend it.

We had a bit of trouble with check-in and getting our car parked in the courtyard and had to wait up the street for about 15 minutes before getting a response. Location was excellent. It’s only a couple blocks from a main shopping street with restaurants and shops. The parking was convenient. You’ll need to have a small car if you want to park in the courtyard. The bed was super comfortable. Soft and plush. I personally liked the big pillows, but my husband did not (he prefers flat pillows). The water pressure in the shower was amazing. Plenty of hot water as well. There is a little balcony that overlooks the courtyards. You may even see a random cat lying on a brick wall. The building was a little noisy at night. We could hear other guests going up the stairs and having full conversations. The apartment door isn’t very thick so it doesn’t block the sound from the staircase. We occasionally heard a dog barking outside as well. Bring earplugs for sleeping, if you are a light sleeper. Apartment was clean and bright though. Only thing that would have been nice is to have a roll of paper towels. We brought back food and it would have been nice to have paper towels (since we didn’t have any napkins). \n\nOverall, great place to stay. We enjoyed Porto and this apartment was central to most things.
