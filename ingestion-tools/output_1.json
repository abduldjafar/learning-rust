NO Resort Fees! Included in the \"Cleaning Fee\" is departure cleaning, reservation fee and Accidental Damage Program fee.   CHECK-IN - Once you’re in Honolulu, you will need to make a phone call to arrange a time for your personal check-in.  A cell phone is preferred in case the property manager needs to call you back.    EARLY CHECK-IN/LATE CHECK-OUT: Because a previous guest may check out of the condo at 11am the day of your arrival, the only way to guarantee an early check-in (8am or later) is to reserve the condo for an additional day.  Likewise, we will do our best to accommodate late check-out requests but as the next guest may check in at 3pm the day of your departure, we cannot guarantee a late check-out unless you reserve the condo for an additional day.","transit":"Public transportation is readily available, extremely reliable, and located right outside the building on Kalakaua Ave!","access":"お部屋のﾄﾞｱは､ｷｰﾚｽ電子ﾛｯｸ!","interaction":"Our property manager will meet you at the condo for your personal check-in!

The property was even better than anticipated - clean and well supplied, superb location, and kind and helpful staff made it truly memorable. The two bedroom, two bath condo was ideal for us and our two small children, with plenty of room to spread out. We cooked breakfast there every morning and so enjoyed starting our days on the lanai. The beach directly across the street was perfect for our small children, and we were an easy stroll to many restaurants, shopping and activities. Walking distance from the Waikiki aquarium was nice too. The view truly cannot be beat. This was a wonderful spot to stay, we can't wait to come back."}]}
