We always use hotels and serviced apartments for our holiday trips. The apartment itself is well renovated and the location is great, however there are a couple of misses that we'd like to point out in this review. COMMUNICATION: During our last night, we sent a message to Matthew and asked permission if we can check out at around 12-1pm as we are sending our family to the airport. He replied that we are only allowed to leave our bags in the apartment until 2pm because they need to clean the house. At 9 AM before going to the airport, we neatly placed our belongings including our souvenirs in the living room next to the TV. At 10:19 AM I even gave Matthew a call that we are on our way back to the house from the airport and we will be arriving back before 12 noon. We returned to the apartment on time to pick our belongings. We were in shock to find out that the cleaner/co-host Chris THREW AWAY our souvenir bag in the rubbish bin outside the house!!! The souvenirs are two fragile wax model of our hands from Madame Tussauds which we had made for our 6th wedding anniversary!!! It was kept nicely in a box and a Madame Tussauds souvenir tote bag. We could not comprehend how Chris could mistook it for rubbish! To make it worse, it was raining during that day and the rubbish bin was wet and dirty. This Chris kept making excuses and blamed Matthew that he wasn't informed that we will leave our belongings. However even if he was not informed by Matthew, he still has NO RIGHT to touch the guests' belongings and more so throw it to the rubbish bin. Clearly, communication was not the only issue here but also the lack of common sense. CLEANLINESS: 1.) The basement bedroom has a strong musty odour on the day of arrival and smells like sewage everytime we go back to the apartment after spending the day on tour. They only have a Glen 20 spray which did not mask the odour. 2.) On day of arrival, there is a lock of hair (possibly from the previous guests) in the kitchen trash bin. There are also left over drinks (soft drinks and juices) inside the fridge. 3.) Upon arrival, we strictly followed the No Shoes policy in the house straight away. However, as Matthew was touring us inside...he had his shoes ON while walking around the house which made the floor dirty. 4.) Dusty tables beside the bed and underneath the TV in the basement bedroom. 5.) My brother saw cockroaches in the Attic bedroom on two occasions. 6.) The sheets on the first floor bedroom smelled nice, however, the sheets on the Attic bedroom smelled musty...."},{"_id":"210503159","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1510203600000"}},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"131981365","reviewer_name":"Jamie","comments":"Great area and a very cool place!"},{"_id":"211711154","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1510635600000"}},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"32196809","reviewer_name":"Nichola","comments":"Great place for a group - six of us fit very comfortably.

He showed us where everything was located, and was friendly and welcoming.\n\nInside, the apartment is filled with amenities and welcoming touches that made us feel right at home.

Next to oxford st and walking distance to almost anywhere you need to be\n- fully renovated property. \n- 3 spacious bedrooms easily fit the 6 of us.\n- great hosts and check in process with easy check in and excellent communication \n\nCons:\n- wifi. For us was fairly inconsistent and slow in patches of the day despite resetting modem.\n- tv in main living room has signal issues and unable to watch some free to air channels.\n- noise. Stayed over a weekend and due to the fact the terrace is close to the street and a stones throw to Oxford st you do get noise. We had a couple of prank knocks over our weekend and so I wouldn’t say it’s ideal for families or those wanting to get on uninterrupted sleep. \n\nAll in all a great stay despite minor issues.

The downstairs \"wine cellar\" was a bit scary at first, but it made things interesting. The second bedroom was perfect in the sense that it had a good mix of a specious bedroom and best bathroom of the house. The top floor bedroom's bathroom was very tight and the downstairs bathroom seemed to get soaked everywhere when you showered. Overall, it was a very neat place to stay.

However, there are quirks that may mean it is not suitable for every group. For 2-3* couples it is a nice stay, and groups of friends should consider the review before they make up their mind.\n\nThe use of space is stunning and creative, so, as long as the below is ok for you – I would definitely recommend the place.   A little more detail in the description would help match expectations. For example, the top bedroom size is better for a close couple or one single - as it is very small and you can look straight at the toilet, which also has no door. The downstairs bedroom is also more suited to couples, given there is no toilet door on its ensuite either. There doesn't appear to be any extra space to adequately fit the spare mattresses offered, so we would recommend no more than five guests or three couples (if the third couple can squeeze into the top level).  Aircon was not available in the downstairs bedroom. There was no hanging space in the middle-floor room as the cupboard was locked. The stairs are very narrow and need to be navigated slowly & with feet sideways to avoid falls. We had a small hiccup getting access to the carpark at check-in, which I assume was a one-off."},{"_id":"407650887","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1549083600000"}},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"215527536","reviewer_name":"Christina","comments":"非常好的房东 在门口迎接我们 介绍了房子的所有功能 用品 房子简直就是一个小别墅 一层厨房 二三层 地下一层各有一个房间和一个卫生间"},{"_id":"409129581","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1549429200000"}},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"73719813","reviewer_name":"思瀚","comments":"位置很棒｡厨房设施齐全｡房东非常好,给我们很多建议和帮助｡由于晚上的飞机,还主动帮我们寄存行李,非常贴心的体验｡感谢~"},{"_id":"412144528","date":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1550120400000"}},"listing_id":"9516607","reviewer_id":"67504262","reviewer_name":"Lora","comments":"Phillip’s place is beautiful and in the perfect location.
