Crystal clear, calm water and pretty seashells. Its also nice and protected so you don’t get blown away or sandblasted which happens on some other beaches.  Just past the beach is a path to the national park, which is so pretty. There were lots of birds and trees and beautiful giant rocks and some Aboriginal carvings. \r\n\r\nIt bucketed rain most of the weekend we were there but we still had a lovely weekend.

Belinda let us have our space and at the same time was very helpful, giving my friend a ride to the ferry and providing tips on Bundeena. \r\nAll you hear are birds, the wind through the trees and the ocean a couple blocks away. The National Park is around a corner and you're at the north tip of the beautiful coastal walk, which if you did it in its entirety would take two full days, requiring camping.

The position of the studio is perfect, only a few minutes in either direction for a waterfront walk and to the local cafes and well-stocked IGA.

Generous size space with a lush, green garden and close to all amenities.  You cross the road and the beach is right there, about 3 minutes to the RSL, 6 minutes walk to IGA and 2 minutes from Jibbon Beach from where you can do a walk.  Only 4 minutes drive to Beachcomber Ave from where you can start the Royal National Park coastal walk - a really stunning walk.  And Belinda is, well, just a beautiful human being!
